Motivation
========================================================

- Differences in armed conflict in Western countries vs. Global South
- Quality of life vs. armed conflict
- Relationship amongst warring sides

SES Data Set

World Bank Data Set
========================================================

- Extracted using an R package titled `WDI`
- Choose 17 Indicators
  - Health expenditure, total (% of GDP)
  - Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1000 live births)
  - Refugee population by country or territory of asylum
  - Refugee population by country or territory of origin
  - Access to electricity (% of population)

Armed Conflict Set
==================================
- Uppsala Conflict Data Program  (UCDP) at the department of Peace and Conflict Research
- Uppsala University and the Centre for the Study of Civil War at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)
- Internal and external conflict from 1946 to the present

â€œA contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or
territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the
government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year"

Wrangling Steps
==================================
- Merging conflicts
- Created a function to speperate and replicate values
- Renamed countries based on familiarity
- Removed specific regions in WBD set



Wrangling Example
==================================
Example of wrong value:

```
# A tibble: 5 x 4
         location               sidea               `side b`  year
            <chr>               <chr>                  <chr> <int>
1 India, Pakistan Government of India Government of Pakistan  1948
2 India, Pakistan Government of India Government of Pakistan  1964
3 India, Pakistan Government of India Government of Pakistan  1965
4 India, Pakistan Government of India Government of Pakistan  1971
5 India, Pakistan Government of India Government of Pakistan  1984

Limitations
========================
- Armed conflict set is under-reported
- Singular attacks won't have a grand effect on indicators
- Time
